# My venture into learning rust

Watned to learn and use concepts as:
* Generics
* Traits
* Iterators
* Streams
* Async/await
* Multithreading
* Cross/thread state sharing for performance (I might do a channel version too).
* Making http calls
* Hosting REST Api
* File system
* Pattern matching
* Logging system
* Writing unit tests
* Unsafe code
* Lock-less multi-threaded code
